    "text": "Task 1\n\n\nTell me what is the boiling point of the reaction product between isoamyl acetate and ethanol. To do this, predict the product of this reaction, and find its boiling point\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 no tools\nI need to find the SMILES of isoamyl acetate and ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: isoamyl acetate\nObservation: CC(C)CCOC(C)=O\nThought: I now have the SMILES of isoamyl acetate. I need the SMILES of ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: ethanol\nObservation: CCO\nThought: I have the SMILES of both isoamyl acetate and ethanol. I will now predict the product of their reaction.\nAction: Reaction prediction\nAction Input: CC(C)CCOC(C)=O.CCO\nObservation: CC(C)CCO\nThought: I have the SMILES of the reaction product. I need to find the name of this molecule to search for its boiling point.\nAction: Obtain molecule name\nAction Input: CC(C)CCO\nObservation: 123-51-3\nThought: I have the name of the molecule as its CAS number (123-51-3). I will now search for its boiling point.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: 123-51-3 boiling point\nObservation: Boiling Point: 130 °C(lit.)\nThought: I now know the boiling point of the reaction product.\nFinal Answer: The boiling point of the reaction product between isoamyl acetate and ethanol is 130 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 + chemtools\nFirst, I need to find the SMILES of isoamyl acetate and ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: isoamyl acetate\nObservation: CC(C)CCOC(C)=O\nThought: Now I have the SMILES of isoamyl acetate, I need to get the SMILES of ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: ethanol\nObservation: CCO\nThought: Now I have the SMILES of both isoamyl acetate and ethanol, I need to predict the product of their reaction.\nAction: Reaction prediction\nAction Input: CC(C)CCOC(C)=O.CCO\nObservation: CC(C)CCO\nThought: Now I have the product of the reaction, I need to find its boiling point.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: CC(C)CCO boiling point\nObservation: Because of this, water boils at 99.97 °C (211.95 °F) under standard pressure at sea level, but at 93.4 °C (200.1 °F) at 1,905 metres (6,250 ft) altitude. For a …\nThought: The web search result seems unrelated to the boiling point of the reaction product. I need to try another search with the molecule’s name.\nAction: Obtain molecule name\nAction Input: CC(C)CCO\nObservation: 123-51-3\nThought: Now I have the registry number of the reaction product, I will use it to search for its boiling point.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: 123-51-3 boiling point\nObservation: Boiling Point: 130 °C(lit.)\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The boiling point of the reaction product between isoamyl acetate and ethanol is 130°C."
