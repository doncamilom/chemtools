    "text": "Here we showcase the use of LLMs in the context of chemical reasoning for the solution of challenging tasks requiring planning, multistep decision making, and tool exploitation.\nIn our approach, we instruct an LLM to solve some task by using a set of predefined tools for chemistry, while reasoning step-by-step. Our results show how LLMs can be used to solve rutinary, as well as more involved tasks in chemistry, while lowering the entry barrier to a simple text request.\nThis work is powered by Langchain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.\nBelow we propose some sample tasks in chemistry that we give a language model to solve. Left is plain GPT-4‚Äôs solution, and right is the solution of GPT-4 using our toolset.\nIf you want to propose a task, tool, or just want to discuss, feel free to contact us!\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\nTell me what is the boiling point of the reaction product between isoamyl acetate and ethanol. To do this, predict the product of this reaction, and find its boiling point\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 no tools\n\nThe reaction between isoamyl acetate and ethanol will most likely involve a transesterification reaction, where the alcohol group of ethanol would replace the acetate group in isoamyl acetate to form a new ester and acetic acid as a side product.\nIsoamyl acetate: CH3COO(CH2)4CH3 Ethanol: CH3CH2OH\nProduct of the reaction: Isoamyl alcohol and Acetic acid\nIsoamyl alcohol: (CH3)2CHCH2CH2OH Acetic acid: CH3COOH\nThe boiling point of isoamyl alcohol is 131.1¬∞C (268¬∞F) and the boiling point of acetic acid is 118.1¬∞C (244.6¬∞F). Since these are two separate products, they don‚Äôt have a combined boiling point.\n\n\n\nGPT-4 + chemtools\n\nFirst, I need to find the SMILES of isoamyl acetate and ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: isoamyl acetate\nObservation:  CC(C)CCOC(C)=O\nThought:  Now I have the SMILES of isoamyl acetate, I need to get the SMILES of ethanol.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: ethanol\nObservation:  CCO\nThought:  Now I have the SMILES of both isoamyl acetate and ethanol, I need to predict the product of their reaction.\nAction: Reaction prediction\nAction Input: CC(C)CCOC(C)=O.CCO\nObservation:  CC(C)CCO\nThought:  Now I have the product of the reaction, I need to find its boiling point.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: CC(C)CCO boiling point\nObservation:  Because of this, water boils at 99.97 ¬∞C (211.95 ¬∞F) under standard pressure at sea level, but at 93.4 ¬∞C (200.1 ¬∞F) at 1,905 metres (6,250 ft) altitude. For a ‚Ä¶\nThought:  The web search result seems unrelated to the boiling point of the reaction product. I need to try another search with the molecule‚Äôs name.\nAction: Obtain molecule name\nAction Input: CC(C)CCO\nObservation:  123-51-3\nThought:  Now I have the registry number of the reaction product, I will use it to search for its boiling point.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: 123-51-3 boiling point\nObservation:  Boiling Point: 130 ¬∞C(lit.)\nThought:  I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The boiling point of the reaction product between isoamyl acetate and ethanol is 130¬∞C.\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\nI need a sample of nicotine or some similar molecule. Propose a list of 3 similar molecules, find the price of each of these molecules, and sort them by similarity.\n\n\n\nGPT-4 no tools\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nPrice: $25 for 5 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution (source: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sial/n3876?lang=en&region=US)\nSimilarity: 100% (it‚Äôs the same molecule)\n\n\nAnabasine\n\n\nPrice: $54 for 10 mg (source: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sial/284353?lang=en&region=US)\nSimilarity: High (Anabasine is an alkaloid found in the tobacco plant; it has a similar structure to nicotine and also acts as a stimulant)\n\n\nCotinine\n\n\nPrice: $43 for 5 mg (source: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sial/c5923?lang=en&region=US)\nSimilarity: Moderate (Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine and has a similar structure, but its pharmacological effects are weaker than nicotine)\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4 + chemtools\n\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: Nicotine\nObservation:  SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1\nThought: Now that I have the SMILES of nicotine, I need to find 3 similar molecules.\nAction: Molecular similarity calculator\nAction Input: SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1, 3\nObservation:  Error: Not a valid SMILES string\nThought: It seems my method to find similar molecules didn‚Äôt work. I will try a web search to find molecules similar to nicotine.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: molecules similar to nicotine\nObservation:  Neonicotinoids, which are derived from and structurally similar to nicotine, are widely used as agricultural and veterinary pesticides as of 2016.\nThought: I found out that neonicotinoids are structurally similar to nicotine. I will identify 3 examples of neonicotinoids and find their SMILES.\nAction: Web search\nAction Input: 3 examples of neonicotinoids\nObservation:  Neonicotinoids are a new class of insecticides with widespread use in veterinary medicine and crop production. The neonicotinoid insecticides include imidacloprid, acetamiprid, dinotefuran, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin.\nThought: I found 3 examples of neonicotinoids: imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and dinotefuran. I will obtain the SMILES of these molecules.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: Imidacloprid\nObservation:  SMILES[O-][N+](=O)=C1/NCCN1CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1\nThought: Now I have the SMILES of imidacloprid, I will obtain the SMILES of acetamiprid and dinotefuran.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: Acetamiprid\nObservation:  SMILES‚ÄúCN(CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1)C()=N#N‚Äù\nThought: Now I have the SMILES of acetamiprid, I will obtain the SMILES of dinotefuran.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: Dinotefuran\nObservation:  SMILESCNC(NN+=O)=NCC1CCOC1\nThought: I now have the SMILES of nicotine, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and dinotefuran. I will compare their similarity to nicotine.\nAction: Molecular similarity calculator\nObservation:  SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1, SMILES[O-][N+](=O)=C1/NCCN1CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1\nObservation:  The Tanimoto similarity between SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1 and SMILES[O-][N+](=O)=C1/NCCN1CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1 is 0.1452, indicating that the two molecules are not similar.\nThought: I have the similarity between nicotine and imidacloprid. I will compare the similarity of nicotine to acetamiprid and dinotefuran.\nAction: Molecular similarity calculator\nAction Input: SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1, SMILESCN(CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1)C()=N#N\nObservation:  The Tanimoto similarity between SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1 and SMILESCN(CC1=CC=C(Cl)N=C1)C()=N#N is 0.1, indicating that the two molecules are not similar.\nThought: I have the similarity between nicotine and acetamiprid. I will compare the similarity of nicotine to dinotefuran.\nAction: Molecular similarity calculator\nAction Input: SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1, SMILESCNC(NN+=O)=NCC1CCOC1\nObservation:  The Tanimoto similarity between SMILESCN1CCCC1C1=CC=CN=C1 and SMILESCNC(NN+=O)=NCC1CCOC1 is 0.0645, indicating that the two molecules are not similar.\nThought: The similarities between nicotine and the three neonicotinoids are not high. However, since they are structurally related, I will proceed with finding the prices of these molecules and list them as an alternative option.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: Imidacloprid\nObservation:  250.0mg of this molecule cost 52 USD.\nThought: I have found the price of imidacloprid. Now I will find the prices of acetamiprid and dinotefuran.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: Acetamiprid\nObservation:  500g of this molecule cost 191 USD.\nThought: I have found the price of acetamiprid. Now I will find the price of dinotefuran.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: Dinotefuran\nObservation:  100.0mg of this molecule cost 37 USD.\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The list of 3 molecules similar to nicotine are imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and dinotefuran. The prices are as follows: Imidacloprid - 52 USD for 250.0mg, Acetamiprid - 191 USD for 500g, and Dinotefuran - 37 USD for 100.0mg. Their similarity values to nicotine are 0.1452, 0.1, and 0.0645, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\nI need to synthesize a sample of atorvastatin. Please tell me how to synthesize it, and then tell me how much will it cost to buy all the reactants I need. Also tell me if it‚Äôs really cheaper to make it myself than just buying it. If you can‚Äôt determine the price of the reactants, try another synthetic route.\n\n\n\nGPT-4 no tools\n\nI am an AI language model, and I‚Äôm unable to provide you with specific pricing information as it may vary depending on your location and the supplier you choose. However, I can provide you with a general synthesis route for atorvastatin.\nAtorvastatin synthesis involves a series of chemical reactions. Here‚Äôs a general outline of the process:\n\nStart with the commercially available compound diethyl (R)-(+)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-triazolidine-4-carboxylate.\nPerform a nucleophilic substitution reaction on this compound with 4-chlorobutanoyl chloride to obtain the corresponding ester.\nConvert the ester into the corresponding amide using an amine, such as 4-(aminomethyl)pyridine.\nPerform a lactonization reaction on the resulting amide to obtain atorvastatin.\n\nThis is a simplified overview, and the actual synthesis may require optimization and additional steps, depending on the specific conditions and reagents used. It‚Äôs important to note that carrying out chemical syntheses requires a proper laboratory setup, appropriate safety measures, and a good understanding of organic chemistry principles.\n\n\n\nGPT-4 + chemtools\n\nFirst, I need to obtain the SMILES of atorvastatin.\nAction: Get SMILES of molecule\nAction Input: atorvastatin\nObservation:  SMILESCC(C)C1=C(C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=C(N1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(O)=O)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1\nThought: Now I need to plan a synthetic route for atorvastatin.\nAction: Molecular synthesis planner.\nAction Input: SMILESCC(C)C1=C(C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=C(N1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(O)=O)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1\nObservation:  Step 1: Mix SMILESCC(C)c1c(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)n1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(=O)OC(C)(C)C, ClCCl, and O=C(O)C(F)(F)F; this will produce SMILESCC(C)C1=C(C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=C(N1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(O)=O)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1.\nThought: I have the synthetic route for atorvastatin. Now, I will calculate the cost of reactants and compare it to the cost of buying atorvastatin directly.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: SMILESCC(C)c1c(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)n1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(=O)OC(C)(C)C\nObservation:  250mg of this molecule cost 10 USD.\nThought: Now I will get the price of the second reactant.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: ClCCl\nObservation:  500ml of this molecule cost 57 USD.\nThought: Now I will get the price of the third reactant.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: O=C(O)C(F)(F)F\nObservation:  100.0mg of this molecule cost 19 USD.\nThought: Now I will get the price of atorvastatin for comparison.\nAction: Get price of molecule\nAction Input: SMILESCC(C)C1=C(C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=C(N1CCC@@HCC@@HCC(O)=O)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1\nObservation:  1mg of this molecule cost 6 USD.\nThought: I now know the price of the reactants and atorvastatin. I will compare them to determine if it‚Äôs cheaper to synthesize it or buy it directly.\nFinal Answer: The cost of reactants is 10 USD for 250mg of the first reactant, 57 USD for 500ml of the second reactant, and 19 USD for 100mg of the third reactant. The cost of buying atorvastatin directly is 6 USD per 1mg. Depending on the quantity needed, it may or may not be cheaper to synthesize it yourself.\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\nPropose a compound with similar properties to the drug Dasatinib. Find a supplier that sells it. Do this by first finding a few compounds with the same MOA/target, modify the compounds to make a novel (not patented) compound and finally purchase the compound. If custom synthesis is required, draft an email to a synthesis CRO to order.\n\n\n\nGPT-4 no tools\n\nI am not a chemist, but I can suggest a general approach to finding a compound with similar properties to Dasatinib and a supplier that sells it. Here‚Äôs what you might consider doing:\n\nIdentify the target and mechanism of action (MOA) of Dasatinib. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR-ABL, SRC family, and c-KIT kinases.\nSearch for compounds with the same MOA/target. You can use databases like ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) to search for compounds that target the same kinases as Dasatinib.\nIdentify a few promising compounds and modify them to create a novel compound. This step requires expertise in medicinal chemistry and knowledge of patent databases to ensure that the novel compound is not patented. You may want to consult with a medicinal chemist or conduct an extensive literature review to explore different modifications to the lead compounds.\nOnce you have a novel compound, search for suppliers that sell the compound or have the capability to synthesize it. You can use chemical suppliers‚Äô websites like Sigma-Aldrich (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) or Chemspace (https://chem-space.com/) to search for the compound or find similar compounds. If custom synthesis is required, you can search for companies that specialize in custom synthesis, such as Enamine (https://enamine.net/) or WuXi AppTec (https://www.wuxiapptec.com/).\nIf you need to order custom synthesis, draft an email to the synthesis CRO with the necessary details. Here‚Äôs a template you can use:\n\nSubject: Custom Synthesis Inquiry for a Novel Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor\nDear [CRO Contact Name],\nI hope this email finds you well.
